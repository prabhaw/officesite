            KTM Rush originally started out in late 2014 by founders Rajen Kaji
            Shrestha and Aaditya Rai. We started to diversify in order to
            provide a wider range of creative and digital marketing services. We
            chose this direction because customer feedback told us that
            businesses wanted a full range of marketing services delivered by
            one agency; not a long list of many. Since then, Eraz Shrestha has
            joined the team to manage customer accounts,post-sales and ensuring
            the smooth running of our growing agency and adding new ideas to the
            ever evolving team.
